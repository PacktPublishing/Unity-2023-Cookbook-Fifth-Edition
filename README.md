  <summary><h2>Requirements for this book</summary>

For all chapters, you will need Unity 2023.1 or later, plus one of the following computer systems:
- Microsoft Windows 10 (64-bit)/GPU: DX10, DX11, and DX12-capable
- macOS GPU Metal-capable Intel or AMD
- Mojave 10.14+ / Intel x64 with SSE2 instruction set support
- Big Sur 11.0 / Apple Silicon M1 or later
- Linux Ubuntu 20.04 or Ubuntu 18.04 / Gnome desktop running on X11 / GPU: OpenGL 3.2+ or Vulkan-capable Nvidia or AMD
For each chapter, there is a folder in the book’s GitHub repository that contains the asset files you will need; you can find these at https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Unity-2023-Cookbook-Fifth-
Edition.

For recipes in some chapters, additional hardware/software will be helpful:
- Chapter 4, Playing and Manipulating Sounds

    To edit and create audio files yourself, you can download and install the free Audacity application
    for your computer system (Windows/Mac/Linux). You can find it at https://www.audacityteam.org/download/.

- Chapter 5, Textures, Materials, and 3D Objects

    To work with 3D objects in the Blender editor, you can download it for free at www.blender.org.

- Chapter 10, Saving and Loading Data

    Since some of the recipes in this chapter make use of web servers and a database, for
    those recipes, you will require either the PHP 8 language (which comes with its own
    web server and SQLite database features) or an AMP package.
    - If you are installing the PHP language, refer to the installation guide and download links:
        - https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php
        - https://www.php.net/downloads
    - If you do want to install a web server and database server application, a great choice is
    XAMPP. It is a free, cross-platform collection of everything you need to set up a database
    and web server on your local computer. The download page also contains FAQs and
    installation instructions for Windows, Mac, and Linux: https://www.apachefriends.
    org/download.html.

- Chapter 15, Particle Systems and Other Visual Effects

    If you wish to create your own image files, you will also need an image editor, such as Adobe
    Photoshop, which can be found at www.adobe.com, or GIMP, which is a free alternative and
    can be found at www.gimp.org/.

- Chapter 16, Mobile Games and Apps
    If developing for Android, you’ll need an Android mobile device.
    If developing for Apple iOS, you’ll need:
        - An Apple iOS mobile device.
        - A free Apple ID, which you can create on an Apple device or at https://appleid.
        apple.com/.
        - A Mac computer with the free Xcode program editor installed.
   - Note: If you don’t have access to a Mac computer and Xcode, another way to
        develop for Apple iOS is to use Unity’s Cloud Build services. Learn more about
        Cloud Build for iOS at https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.1/Documentation/
        Manual/UnityCloudBuildiOS.html.

- Chapter 17, Augmented Reality (AR)

    To get the most from this chapter’s recipes, you will need an AR device. For this, you can use
    a dedicated device such as an AR headset, or you can use smartphone apps to begin experiencing
    AR.

- Chapter 18, Virtual Reality (VR) and Extended Reality (XR)

    You will need a device to view VR apps. For this, you can use a dedicated device, such as a VR
    headset like the Meta Quest 1/2/3, Samsung Gear VR, or Apple Vision Pro. If you wish to use a
    smartphone for VR projects, there are many low-cost devices to choose from, such as Google
    Cardboard: https://developers.google.com/cardboard

  <summary><h2>Get to know Authors</h2></summary>
   
_Matt Smith_ is senior lecturer at TU Dublin, the Technological University of Dublin, Ireland, specialising in XR and interactive multimedia. He leads the university’s DRIVE (Digital Realities, Interaction, and Virtual Environments) research group, and is currently supervising several PhD students in interaction design and XR technologies. In 1980, Matt started computer programming (on a ZX80). A few years later he submitted his first two games for the programming project component of his ‘O’-level computing certificate (aged 16). In 1985, Matt wrote the lyrics, and was a member of the band that played (and sang, sorry about that by the way) the music on the B-side of the audio cassette carrying the computer game Confuzion (the game/song has a Wikipedia page...). In 2024, No Starch Press will publish his PHP Crash Course. Matt is still (pleasantly!) surprised at the popularity of his Unity Cookbook series – whose beginning was a book proposal sent to Packt Publishing over 10 years ago.

_Shaun Ferns_ is an academic at TU Dublin, the Technological University of Dublin, Ireland, where he is a researcher in the DRIVE (Digital Realities, Interaction, and Virtual Environments) research group and an associate researcher at the Educational Informatics Lab (EILab) at OntarioTechU. Since 2016, he has been primarily researching and teaching multimedia development, and prior to that was involved in the delivery of several engineering programs. He is currently exploring the opportunities transmedia provides in improving user experience and engagement in cultural archive artifacts and serious games for the built environment. Shaun began to “play” with Unity when designing and building his house in 2010, developing an architectural walk-through to support the development of the design of the new home. Since then, he has been working on several Unity-based cultural projects and hopes to complete one soon! Shaun has taken up the challenge of playing the Irish tenor banjo and currently enjoys playing in Irish traditional music sessions with his friends. When not practicing, he can be found wandering the cliffs and mountains around Donegal or swimming its Atlantic shores.

_Sinéad Murphy_ is currently Data Analytics Manager for the Irish NGO Trócaire. She has over 25 years of computing experience, including freelance IT training and database consulting, university lecturing in mathematics, IT skills, and programming at TU Dublin (Ireland) and Middlesex University (London). She is a published academic, with undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in mathematics, computing, and data science. She is passionate about the use of IT for understanding and visualising data, and using that understanding to make meaningful differences in the world. She is currently exploring the use of Python and Unity for data analytics and interactive visualisations.
